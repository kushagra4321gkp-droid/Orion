I started coding in python 1 month ago.
<br>
But i didn't learn git and github at that time so,
<br>
I used to save my files in a Folder.
<br>
I use PyCharm Code Editor to run my Python Code.
<br>
In this Repo I have compiled all my code together,
<br>
and also i will commit here my future code as well.
<br>
I have built small projects and wrote codes about the python concepts.
<br> 
I made sure that i write redable code.
<br>
If you are a complete beginner, then surely you can get benifited.
<br>
Read my Code / Learn from my POV / Grow
<br>
Happy Learning
